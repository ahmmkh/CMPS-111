For my contribution, I found and modified the functions that inserted pages 
for the inactive/active queue, a function that reinserted pages back into 
queues and changed the page out scan to 10 seconds. The changes were very
simple because our assignment wanted pages to be inserted at front instead 
of rear so just changing the TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL to TAIL_INSERT_HEAD did the 
trick. In addition, I helped my team debug any errors and brain stormed ideas 
on how to analyze the data we gathered. I would rate my team members as people 
who tried their best to get the assignment done.
