We modified four files: vm_page.h, vm_page.c, vm_pageout.c, vm_phys.c

vm_page.h:
Starting on line 379, we have 4 variables: active_to_inactive, inactive_to_active, 
inactive_to_cacheFree,and number_pages_queue_for_flush. 

vm_page.c:
In function _vm_page_deactivate(2474), we changed TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL to TailQ_INSERT_HEAD because
pages moved to the inactive are moved to the front which is the head.

In vm_page_deactivate(2488), we changed _vm_page_deactivate(m, 0) to _vm_page_deactivate(m, 1)
which sets the athead parameter to 1 and inserts the page at the head of inactive queue. 

In vm_page_requeue(2139), we changed TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL to TAILQ_INSERT_HEAD so pages that
are reinserted are put at the front.

In vm_page_requeue_locked(2162), we changed TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL to TAILQ_INSERT_HEAD for the same
reason as vm_page_requeue.

In vm_page_enqueue(2115), we changed TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL to TAILQ_INSERT_HEAD so pages that are
added to the specified queue are added to the front of the queue.

vm_phys.c:
In vm_freelist_add(246), we commented out the if statement and left the TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL so
that invalid/inactive pages are added to the rear of the free list.

vm_pageout.c:
In vm_pageout_scan(1501), we changed m->act_count -= min(m->act_count, ACT_DECLINE) to
m->act_count = m->act_count/2 because the activity count is halved instead of subtracted.

In vm_pageout_init(1874), we changed vm_pageout_update_period = 600 to vm_pageout_update_period = 10
because we wanted the pageout scan to run more frequently. 

On line 1532, we call the log function to print out the value of variables that record
the data we use for our Writeup pdf. Variables are 
number_Inactive_scanned: Number of inactive pages scanned
number_active_scanned: Number of active pages scanned
inactive_to_cacheFree: Number of pages moved to inactive queue to cache
inactive_to_active: Number of pages moved from inactive to active queue
active_to_inactive: Number of pages moved from active to inactive queue
cnt.v_active_count: number of pages that are active
cnt.v_inactive_count: number of pages that are inactive
number_pages_queued_for_flush: number of pages that have been flushed
