For this project, I was largely responsible for creating the system calls: getkey and setkey. I modified the syscall.master to recognize the system calls. In setkey, I grabbed the two unsigned long k0 and k1 and combined them in a 64 bit variable. Then I stored them in a struct one of my partners created and kept track of how many keys are inserted inside the array. For getkey, I just looped the entire struct array and compared the give id to all the user id's stored inside the array and if i got a hit, I would return k0 and k1.
